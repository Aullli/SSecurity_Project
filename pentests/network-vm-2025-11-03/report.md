Executive Summary — Network Pentest (network-vm-2025-11-03)

Date: 2025-11-03
Tester: Aullli (lab)
Scope: Host-only VM lab; active scanning and controlled PoC only

Summary of Findings

Anonymous FTP with exposed writable file — High
Evidence: Anonymous FTP access was available; a file named creds.txt was found in the FTP root directory.
Impact: Potential credential/configuration leakage that could lead to further system compromise.

Pluck CMS on port 38080 — High
Evidence: HTTP service running on TCP/38080 is identified as Pluck CMS (via meta generator) with accessible /login.php.
Impact: Unprotected admin interface and potentially outdated CMS version may be exploitable.
Short Recommendations (priority)
Immediately remove sensitive files and disable anonymous FTP; review external exposure.

Patch & harden Pluck CMS; restrict access to the admin page (IP allowlist / VPN / basic auth).
Rotate credentials if leakage is suspected.
Store raw artifacts in encrypted storage; provide sanitized artifacts in the repository.

Next Steps
Perform plugin and configuration audit of Pluck CMS.
Run credential rotation checks and forensic analysis on FTP logs.
