- **Severity:** High
- **Evidence:**
  - nmap output: pentests/network-vm-2025-11-03/nmap/nmap-full-TARGET.nmap
  - ftp listing (sanitized): pentests/network-vm-2025-11-03/tools-output/ftp-listing-192.168.1.12.txt
- **Description:**
  Anonymous FTP login allowed. A writable file `creds.txt` was observed in the FTP root, which may contain credentials or sensitive data.
- **Reproduction (sanitized):**
  1. `nmap --script ftp-anon -p21 TARGET_IP`
  2. `lftp -u anonymous,anonymous ftp://TARGET_IP` -> `ls`
- **Impact:**
  Exposed credentials or backups can allow attackers to gain further access.
- **Recommendation:**
  - Disable anonymous FTP or restrict access.
  - Remove any sensitive files from FTP roots and rotate any exposed credentials.
  - Harden FTP permissions and audit logs.

- **Severity:** Medium
- **Evidence:**
  - HTTP headers: pentests/network-vm-2025-11-03/tools-output/http-38080-headers-192.168.1.12.txt
  - Page snapshot / body (redacted): pentests/network-vm-2025-11-03/tools-output/http-38080-body-192.168.1.12.txt
- **Description:**
  An alternate web application (Pluck CMS v4.7.13 indicated) is accessible on port 38080. The site references `/login.php` for admin access.
- **Reproduction (sanitized):**
  1. `curl -I -L http://TARGET_IP:38080`
  2. `nmap -p 38080 --script http-title,http-enum TARGET_IP`
- **Impact:**
  Unpatched or misconfigured CMS instances can be exploited to achieve RCE or credential disclosure.
- **Recommendation:**
  - Ensure the CMS is patched to the latest secure version.
  - Restrict access to admin endpoints (IP allowlist / authentication).
  - Review plugins & remove unused ones, enforce strong admin passwords.
