This lab uses VMs from the vendor/OVA which obtain IP addresses via DHCP. As a result, the target IP address may change after the VM is restarted.  
When reproducing tests, replace any \`TARGET_IP\` placeholders with the current VM IP. To discover the VM IP:

- inside the VM: \`ip a\` or \`hostname -I\`
- from the attacking machine: scan the lab subnet (e.g. \`nmap -sn 192.168.56.0/24\`) or use \`arp -a\`
- if using NAT with port-forwarding, access services via host:port instead
# Network Pentest — VM Lab (2025-8-27)

Summary: local VM pentest on 192.168.1.14

Tools:
- nmap: discovery and service enumeration
- searchsploit: offline exploit lookup
- netcat / reverse shell: PoC for command execution
- OSINT: google dorks, gtfobins, linpeas
- linpeas: privilege escalation

Structure:
- scope.txt
- notes.md (commands to reproduce)
- nmap/ (raw outputs)
- tools-output/ (searchsploit, gobuster, etc.)
- findings.md
- assets/screenshots

How to reproduce:
1. Ensure VM network is host-only
2. Run: nmap -p- 192.168.1.14
3. FTP target
4. get .txt
5. search FTP's vuln but didn't get what we need
6. searching vuln in other port
7. get pluck vuln
8. using the pluck vuln
9. get the webshell
10. make interaktif shell
11. do a privilege escalation using linpeas
12. searching for another vuln
13. get vuln hping3
14. get the root
